# Simple Crud Application

## Purpose

The purpose of this project was playing with useDispatch in typescript, creating unit test for reducer functionality and mean while trying to create a simple theme using css variables.

## Functionality:

-   You can add item to the list via modal, which open when you click `Add` button.
-   You can select and unselect added items
-   You can delete added items via `Delete` button, but only if the item is selected
-   You can clear all items via `Clear` button, but only if there are some.

Adding to the list, but not modal input control, selecting, deleting and clearing is handled by reducer.
